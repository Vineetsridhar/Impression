# Project3 - Impression

# About
COVID-19 has had a big impact on daily life. One aspect that was immediately affected by the virus was academics.
With the need of everything becoming virtual, students have been taking their education at home from their laptops and/or mobile devices.
All activities and events that students usually participated in were made virtual, as well, including career fairs and recruitment opportunities.
Due to this, recruiters and students struggle to find ways to make a virtual connection to be as successful as an in-person one;
it has become an arduous task for recruiters and applicants to exchange information. This is where our application, Impression, comes in.

By giving each user a unique QR code to scan, Impression will allow the user to make connections on the spot through their mobile devices.
These connections will add users to each other's contact list and store the users' personal information, like how to contact them, resume, links to personal websites, etc.
Companies will be able to attach any important documents about their mission statement, open positions, or any other information they want be made readily available.
Impression will allow for a seamless exhcange of information between users and will reduce the amount of paper often used during career fairs and/or interviews,
as all the information will be stored virtually for the users to revisit if need be.

# Setup
NOTE: This was needed for me on ubuntu linux, proceed with caution. May delete these steps if not needed.

1. Run the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` to verify you have the latest versions of node and npm installed. If not updated, update with the commands `npm install -g npm`.

2. Add your PATH to your `~/.profile` with `echo "export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin" >> ~/.profile`.
3. To avoid having to source `~/.profile` upon terminal startup, run the command `echo "source ~/.profile" >> ~/.bashrc`

4. In another terminal, change directories with `cd ~/Impression`.

# Linting
For linting, we decided to ignore these errors/warnings:
1. E1101 (no-member) for all python files that have to do with the SQLAlchemy instances
2. R0902 (too-many-instance-attributes) because we need that many instances for our project
3. R0903 (too-few-public-methods) because we just need these classes to store data
4. R0913 (too-many-arguments) because our table needs those specific arguments for the users information
5. C0114 (missing-module-docstring)/C0115 (missing-class-docstring)/C0116 (missing-function-docstring) because
we do not have docstrings for our modules/classes/functions
6. C0413 (wrong-import-position) because we need the import statements after the 'db.session.commit()' in server.py
